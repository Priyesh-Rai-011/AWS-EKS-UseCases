# EKS Secrets Management

Your app needs a database password.

That password cannot live in:
- `application.properties` — committed to Git, public forever
- `Deployment YAML` — same problem, different file
- Environment variable hardcoded in the manifest — same problem
- Baked into the container image — worst of all

So where does it go? And how does the pod prove it's allowed to read it?

Those two questions drive everything in this folder.

## What production actually requires

Before picking a technology, define what the system must guarantee:

```text
- Secrets must not live in Git
- Pods must not use long-lived AWS credentials
- Access must be auditable by identity
- Rotation must happen without redeployment (ideally)
- Blast radius must be bounded per service
- Terraform state must not contain plaintext values
- Threat model determines whether etcd exposure is acceptable
```

When you define requirements first, the architecture emerges naturally. The three folders below are consequences of these requirements — not arbitrary choices.

## The constraint chain

Every architecture here solves the previous one's weakness. That's not coincidence — that's how infrastructure evolves.

```text
Hardcoded in code / YAML
    └── weakness: anyone with Git access has it
            │
            ▼
Kubernetes Native Secret
    └── weakness: lives in etcd, base64 is not encryption,
                  anyone with API access reads it in plain text
            │
            ▼
ESO + AWS Secrets Manager
    └── weakness: source of truth moves outside cluster (good),
                  but ESO still writes a K8s Secret to etcd (still exposed)
            │
            ▼
CSI Driver + ASCP
    └── secret injected directly into pod as tmpfs (RAM),
        never written to etcd, gone when pod dies
```

Each step solves a real problem. Each step introduces a new tradeoff. Understanding the chain is more valuable than memorizing the commands.

ConfigMap needed?      YES                    YES                     YES
Terraform managed?     no                     YES (shell only)        YES (shell only)
```

`ConfigMap` still exists in all three approaches. ESO/CSI handles sensitive values (passwords, tokens). ConfigMap handles non-sensitive config (hostnames, ports, feature flags). They are not in competition.

```

**Key contrast:**

```text
ESO:  3 SM secrets  →  3 ExternalSecrets  →  3 K8s Secrets  →  pods read env vars
CSI:  1 SM secret   →  1 SecretProviderClass  →  tmpfs + optional K8s Secret  →  pods read env vars

Critical CSI rule: volume mount IS the trigger.
No mount on pod = ASCP never fetches = pulseauth-secrets never created = pod crashes.
```

## A note on StorageClass vs SecretProviderClass

These names look similar. They are completely unrelated.

```text
StorageClass         →  PersistentVolumeClaim  →  EBS/EFS volume  →  pod disk (07_EKS_EBS_CSI)
SecretProviderClass  →  CSI volume mount       →  tmpfs (RAM)     →  pod filesystem (03_csi_driver_ascp)
```

Different drivers. Different purpose. Do not confuse them.

## What this folder doesn't cover (yet)

These are real production gaps. Not in scope here, but you'll hit every one of them.

| Gap | What it is | Does it matter? |
| --- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **Secret rotation** | SM rotates the value via Lambda. Pod still holds old env var until restart — ESO re-syncs on `refreshInterval`, CSI re-mounts, but neither is zero-downtime without app-level connection pool refresh. | **High** — breaks apps silently in prod when password rotates under a live connection |
| **KMS Customer Managed Key** | SM encrypts secrets with AWS-managed KMS by default. CMK = you own the key, control the key policy, can audit or disable it. One `kms_key_id` field in TF, but the key + policy setup is real work. | **Medium-High** — hard requirement for PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC2 |
| **VPC Endpoint for Secrets Manager** | Today private-subnet pods reach SM via NAT GW → public internet. An Interface VPC Endpoint keeps traffic inside AWS backbone — no internet egress, lower cost, no NAT dependency. | **Medium** — cost + security, easy add to the VPC module |
| **CloudTrail audit** | Every `GetSecretValue` call lands in CloudTrail automatically. Querying it meaningfully (who read which secret, from which role, when) requires Athena or CloudWatch Logs Insights. | **Low to set up, High to operate** — the data is there, the tooling is not |
| **Sealed Secrets (GitOps pattern)** | Bitnami Sealed Secrets: encrypt a K8s Secret with the cluster's public key, commit the encrypted YAML to Git. Only decryptable inside the cluster. No external system needed — ESO alternative when SM isn't the requirement. | **Low here** — ESO covers the need. Relevant when GitOps is the constraint, not compliance |
| **GitHub Actions OIDC → AWS** | GitHub OIDC federation: CI/CD gets short-lived STS tokens instead of long-lived access keys. No `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` in GitHub Secrets. Required for `docker push` to ECR and `terraform apply` from Actions. | **High** — every automation step in this repo currently has no CI/CD IAM role |
